# Contents

`Makefile.pl` - Running this file with `perl Makefile.PL` creates an actual `Makefile` with certain usages such as

* `make`
* `make test`
* `make install`
* `make manifest`
* `make dist`

## scripts

`template.pl` A single script that has basic modules and usage. Rename this file to what suits you.
You can add more scripts here.

## t

`01_index.t` A single perl script that has a unit test in it. Rename `_index` to what your usage would be.
You can add additional tests in this folder. There is a two digit number here in the script name(s) so that
the scripts will be run in the correct order even though the system will sort alphabetically instead
of numerically.
